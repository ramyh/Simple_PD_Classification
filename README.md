# Simple_PD_Classification
Computationally Efficient Detection Method for Acoustic Partial Discharge Signals

Please compile the MATLAB code "PDClassification_PDF.m" to generate the CSV file "PDClassification_PDF.csv" that includes the feature vectors. WEKA tool can be then used to examine the effectiveness of the selected features using RANDOM FOREST classifier. 
* Do not forget to include the PD data in the MATLAB directory first.
* Please include the MATLAB vector "time_Acoustic" in the MATLAB directory too.
